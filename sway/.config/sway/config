#### i3 config file (v4)
# Riced by bsaw.
# Goals of this configuration:
#   - Add comments over every option for ease of reconfiguration.
#   - Make names self-explainatory where I could.
#   - Categorizing all configuration options into multiple files and sections within those files.
#   - Make configuration code look consistent.
# 
# You can go into specific file to see a brief explanation for what is it's purpose.
# 
# Note: My preferred line limit is 100, however some lines had to go over that limit.
#
